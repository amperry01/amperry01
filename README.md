I'm a Computer Science student at Chapman University (graduating May 2026) with experience in **software engineering** and **machine learning**, including AI/ML model development, fullstack applications, and scalable data pipelines.

I enjoy building projects that blend **machine learning** and **software engineering** to solve real-world problems, from mission-critical aerospace workflows to user-focused applications.

## Current Projects
- **[Sōma: Activity Planner](https://github.com/amperry01/soma-activity-planner) (In Progress)**  
  AI-powered wellness app using Oura health data to predict recovery needs and recommend optimal activity timing.

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, C++, Java, TypeScript, SQL, JavaScript  
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, scikit-learn, RLlib, SHAP, NumPy, Pandas, PIL  
**Fullstack & Tools:** React, Next.js, Node.js, REST APIs, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Docker, Git, Jupyter  
**Other:** Agile/Scrum, Jira, Confluence

## Featured Repositories
