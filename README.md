I'm a Computer Science student at Chapman University (graduating May 2026) with experience in software engineering and machine learning, including AI/ML model development, fullstack applications, and scalable data pipelines.  

I enjoy building projects that blend **machine learning** and **software engineering** to solve real-world problems — from mission-critical aerospace workflows to user-focused applications.
